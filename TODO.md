- [x] Make adjacent motors not pull each other apart*

* Adjacent motors (each motor on one side of the bot) pull in opposite directions when going forwards or backwards. This is a result of the direction of the motors (opposite sides being the opposite direction) which works well for turning, but has unintended side-effects when driving.

Motor pulling should be solved in 0.1.1.
